# Ethical Use Statement — South Shore Sentiment Study

## Purpose
This study analyzes publicly available online discourse to understand community emotional responses to the ICE/CBP enforcement action in South Shore, Chicago on September 30, 2025. The goal is to produce actionable guidance for community organizations providing outreach, legal aid, and mental health services.

## Data Principles

### Public Data Only
- All analyzed text comes from publicly accessible sources: Reddit (public subreddits) and news article comment sections.
- No private messages, direct messages, or login-required content is accessed.
- No data is collected from private or restricted communities.

### No Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
- Usernames and display names are stripped during data cleaning.
- No real names, addresses, phone numbers, or email addresses are collected or stored.
- No individual-level profiles are constructed.
- No attempt is made to identify real-world individuals from their posts.

### No Doxxing or Precise Locations
- Neighborhood analysis uses broad community area buckets (e.g., "South Shore"), never specific addresses.
- No geocoding of individual users is performed.
- Geographic inference is based solely on text mentions, not user metadata.

### Aggregate Outputs Only
- All published results (reports, dashboards, data exports) are at aggregate level: by phase, by neighborhood bucket, by platform.
- Individual posts are **never** reproduced verbatim in any public output.
- Exemplar posts shown in internal QC are paraphrased, not quoted.

## Verification Framework

1. **Official/FOIA** — Government press releases, court filings
2. **Two-Source Media** — Confirmed by 2+ independent outlets
3. **Single-Source Media** — One credible outlet, not independently confirmed
4. **Social Mention** — Individual social media post

## Rate Limiting and Compliance
